Born in 1997 Flucky is one of the upcoming digital artists
who've made a splash in the London code-poetry scene. His
latest work is inspired by the dot-com boom which hit its
peak in the year he was born. This piece, "Vikings", evokes
visual freedom as well as the complexity of the code underlying
our modern world.
